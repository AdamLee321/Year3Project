So, In my latest push, I used modules in the SideBar,SecretaryHeader and SecretaryDash folders

Since Sidebar and SecHeader are to be used elsewhere in different views, I have to list the Componenet I have imported, as an export

In Module A, Listing the imported component also as an export, allows you to use the exported componenet in Module B,
when you import Module A into Module B.

Doing this allows you to directly link modules and components, and you do not have to send the components or modules of Sidebar or SecretaryHeader
to the app.module.ts file.

From my understanding, this is mainly beneficial in the future when we have router modules and services, which will all go through their own respective module.ts.

I believe this will mean that instead of importing everything seperately, we will be simply able to just import the module that contains everything, and viola,
we will have imported everything in the 1 import. However, the only components etc that will be usable will be the parts we select to export.
